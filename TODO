TODO - a todo listing all the changes to be implemented
----

Major
-----
1. Support for sshing into only those hosts that are in the pipeline.
2. Support for pipes, using fork() and execve() instead of system()

Minor
-----
1. Move the SSH persist-exit to a newer function so that execCommand can be called from outside
makePersistentSSH() function.
2. Also, as an implication of doing above, move the makePersistenSSH() for the whole for loop structure instead of
for each pipeline.

Test
----
1. Test how well the filepath parsing regex works in a real life scenario.
2. Test how well the grammar works in parsing real life pipelines.
