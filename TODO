TODO - a todo listing all the changes to be implemented
----

Major
-----
1. Support for sshing into only those hosts that are in the pipeline. DONE
2. Support for pipes, using fork() and execve() instead of system()
3. See if doing 2. causes bytes to be transferred via the local host. If so, see if it can done
in a way without using temporary files - this is assuming that all the hosts have authorization to each other.
4. Make a proper assumption of the network model for this. Assume utmost portability? or a subset of that?

Minor
-----
1. Move the SSH persist-exit to a newer function so that execCommand can be called from outside
makePersistentSSH() function. DONE
2. Also, as an implication of doing above, move the makePersistenSSH() for the whole for loop structure instead of
for each pipeline. DONE

Test
----
1. Test how well the filepath parsing regex works in a real life scenario.
2. Test how well the grammar works in parsing real life pipelines.
